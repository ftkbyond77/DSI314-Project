A central theme is the age-old debate between free trade and protectionism. The text provides a thorough grounding in the arguments surrounding this debate, beginning with a historical overview of trade policy and concluding with a detailed economic argument supporting free trade. Unique features include a comprehensive analysis of a wide range of trade policies, an evaluation of domestic policies (such as taxes and subsidies) that are often ignored in other texts, and a methodical presentation of the theory of the second-best to explain why protectionism can sometimes improve national welfare.

Laurie Snell is a comprehensive textbook designed for an introductory probability course for students in mathematics, sciences, engineering, and computer science. The text traces the history of probability theory from its origins in the 17th-century correspondence between Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. It presents a thorough treatment of probability concepts and techniques necessary for a firm understanding of the subject. The material is organized to present discrete and continuous probability discussions in a separate but parallel manner, which serves a pedagogical value by allowing discrete examples to motivate more abstract continuous concepts. The book is structured into 12 chapters, covering fundamental topics such as Discrete and Continuous Probability Distributions, Combinatorics, Conditional Probability, Expected Value and Variance, the Law of Large Numbers, the Central Limit Theorem, Generating Functions, Markov Chains, and Random Walks. Prerequisites vary depending on the course focus, ranging from one term of calculus for a discrete probability course to two terms, including multiple integrals, for a standard course covering both discrete and continuous probability. The text integrates the use of computer programs (written in TrueBASIC, Maple, and Mathematica) as a tool for simulation and analysis, treating the computer as a laboratory for chance experiments.

A key feature is its 'Applications Ahead of Theory' structure. Each chapter is built around a specific business or policy application, such as minimum wages, the stock exchange, or auctions, and economic theory is introduced as needed to address the application. This contrasts with traditional textbooks that are organized around theoretical constructs. The book also emphasizes 'Learning through Repetition,' where important tools and concepts reappear in different contexts, allowing students to master them and see their versatility.

A key structural change from traditional texts is the reorganization of the introductory material on units, significant figures, and dimensional analysis, placing these topics in the chapters where the concepts are first introduced. The book covers a comprehensive general chemistry curriculum, including atomic structure, bonding, chemical reactions, thermochemistry, kinetics, equilibrium, electrochemistry, and nuclear chemistry, as well as chapters dedicated to the s-block, p-block, and d-block elements.

It is highly organized, with doctrine explained upfront before the presentation of cases, and features a variety of readings, including classic cases and atypical materials like opening statements and administrative-enforcement letters. This volume covers the preliminary concepts of tort law and provides an in-depth treatment of negligence. Key topics include the duty of care (foreseeability, affirmative duties, special relationships), breach of duty (the reasonable person standard, negligence per se, the role of custom), and the negligence calculus.

    "content": "'American Contract Law for a Global Age' by Franklin G. Snyder and Mark Edwin Burge is a casebook primarily for first-year Contracts courses in American law schools, but is also usable as a supplement in upper-level or foreign classes. The book explicitly focuses on U.S. contract law while acknowledging the global context in which modern lawyers operate. It is structured to guide students through the lifecycle of a contract, from formation to remedies. The chapters cover contract formation (agreement, offer, acceptance), consideration (including promissory estoppel), alternative regimes like the UCC and CISG, contract defenses (capacity, Statute of Frauds, assent-based and policy-based defenses), terms and interpretation (parol evidence rule, conditions), performance and breach (including excused performance), remedies (expectation, restitution, reliance), and the rights of nonparties (third-party beneficiaries, assignment, and delegation).

    "URL": "https://www.cali.org/sites/default/files/Nov2017-LGBT-Employment-Discrimination.pdf",
    "access status": "Success",
    "content": "'Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Employment Discrimination' by Matthew W. Green, Jr. is a stand-alone chapter or supplemental text for courses on Employment Discrimination or civil rights. The text focuses on federal statutory law, particularly Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and explores the legal arguments and evolving judicial perspectives on whether discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression constitutes 'discrimination because of sex.' The chapter is divided into four parts. It begins with an overview of congressional efforts to enact federal protections for LGBT employees, such as ENDA. It then examines early judicial rejections of Title VII coverage for sexual orientation, followed by a discussion of how Supreme Court decisions on gender nonconformity (Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins) and same-sex harassment have led some courts to reconsider these earlier positions. The final part examines the legal developments regarding gender identity and expression. The text includes edited cases, notes, questions, and problems to facilitate understanding. It is published by CALI eLangdell Press under a Creative Commons license. [93]"

    "access status": "Success",
    "content": "'An Introduction to Philosophy' by W. Russ Payne is an open-source textbook that presents philosophy as a living discipline with historical roots. The book is structured with a mix of historical and topical chapters. Early chapters trace the development of philosophical thought from ancient philosophy through rationalism and empiricism. Later chapters are organized thematically, covering contemporary areas such as philosophy of science and philosophy of mind. The text concludes with a four-chapter sequence on ethics, which progressively expands the sphere of concern from personal happiness to meta-ethics, theories of right action, and social justice. The author's goal is to outline the continuity of thought from philosophy's origins to its current inquiries. The book is licensed under Creative Commons, includes links to freely available primary source readings, and is designed to be an accessible and adaptable resource for newcomers to philosophy. [94]"

    "content": "'Direct Energy Conversion' by Andrea M. Mitofsky is a textbook that discusses both the physics behind energy conversion processes and a wide variety of energy conversion devices. A direct energy conversion device is one that converts energy from one form to another in a single process. The book is divided into two parts. Part I is a survey of devices that convert to or from electricity, including capacitors, piezoelectric devices, pyroelectrics, electro-optics, antennas, Hall effect devices, photovoltaics, lamps, LEDs, lasers, thermoelectrics, and batteries/fuel cells. For each device, the physical effects are discussed, engineering terminology is introduced, and insights into material selection are provided. Part II places these concepts into a more abstract theoretical framework, introducing ideas such as the calculus of variations (Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics), relationships between different energy conversion processes, Thomas-Fermi analysis, and Lie analysis.
